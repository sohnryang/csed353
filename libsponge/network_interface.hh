//! \brief A "network interface" that connects IP (the internet layer, or network layer)
//! with Ethernet (the network access layer, or link layer).

//! This module is the lowest layer of a TCP/IP stack
//! (connecting IP with the lower-layer network protocol,
//! e.g. Ethernet). But the same module is also used repeatedly
//! as part of a router: a router generally has many network
//! interfaces, and the router's job is to route Internet datagrams
//! between the different interfaces.

//! The network interface translates datagrams (coming from the
//! "customer," e.g. a TCP/IP stack or router) into Ethernet
//! frames. To fill in the Ethernet destination address, it looks up
//! the Ethernet address of the next IP hop of each datagram, making
//! requests with the [Address Resolution Protocol](\ref rfc::rfc826).
//! In the opposite direction, the network interface accepts Ethernet
//! frames, checks if they are intended for it, and if so, processes
//! the the payload depending on its type. If it's an IPv4 datagram,
//! the network interface passes it up the stack. If it's an ARP
//! request or reply, the network interface processes the frame
//! and learns or replies as necessary.
